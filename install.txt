   This document is a guide for installing Arch Linux from the live system
   booted with the official installation image. Before installing, it
   would be advised to view the FAQ. For conventions used in this
   document, see Help:Reading.

   For more detailed instructions, see the respective ArchWiki articles
   (accessible from the installation environment with ELinks), or the
   various programs' man pages; see archlinux(7) for an overview of the
   configuration. For interactive help, the IRC channel and the forums are
   also available.

Pre-installation

   Arch Linux should run on any i686 compatible machine with a minimum of
   256 MB RAM. A basic installation with all packages from the base group
   should take less than 800 MB of disk space.

   Download and boot the installation medium as explained in
   Category:Getting and installing Arch. You will be logged in as the root
   user, and presented with a Zsh shell prompt; common commands such as
   systemctl(1) can be tab-completed.

   To edit configuration files, nano, vi and vim are available.

   The installation process needs to retrieve packages from a remote
   repository, therefore a working internet connection is required.

  Verify the boot mode

   As instructions differ for UEFI systems, verify the boot mode by
   checking efivars:
# ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars

  Set the keyboard layout

   The default console keymap is US. Available choices can be listed with
   ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz.

   The layout can be changed with loadkeys(1), appending a file name (path
   and file extension can be omitted). For example:
# loadkeys de-latin1

   Console fonts are located in /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/, and can
   likewise be set with setfont(8).

  Connect to the Internet

   Internet service via dhcpcd is enabled on boot for supported wired
   devices; check the connection using a tool such as ping(8).

   For other network configuration, systemd-networkd and netctl are
   available. See systemd.network(5) and netctl.profile(5) for examples.

   When using either service, stop dhcpcd@interface.service:
# systemctl stop dhcpcd@interface.service

  Update the system clock

   Use timedatectl(1) to ensure the system clock is accurate:
# timedatectl set-ntp true

   To check the service status, use timedatectl status.

  Partition the disks

   To modify and print partition tables, use fdisk or parted for both MBR
   and GPT, or gdisk(8) for GPT only.

   At least one partition must be available for the / directory. UEFI
   systems additionally require an EFI System Partition. Other partitions
   may be needed, such as a GRUB BIOS boot partition.

   If wanting to create any stacked block devices for LVM, disk encryption
   or RAID, do it now.

  Format the partitions

   See File systems and optionally Swap for details.

  Mount the partitions

   mount(8) the root partition on /mnt. After that, create directories for
   and mount any other partitions (/mnt/boot, /mnt/home, ...) and activate
   your swap partition with swapon(8), if you want them to be detected
   later by genfstab.

Installation

  Select the mirrors

   Edit /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist and select a download mirror(s). Regional
   mirrors usually work best; however, other criteria may be necessary to
   discern, read more on Mirrors.

   This file will later be copied to the new system by pacstrap, so it is
   worth getting right.

  Install the base packages

   Use the pacstrap script to install the base group:
# pacstrap /mnt base

   To install other packages or groups to the new system, such as
   btrfs-progs or a boot loader, append their names to pacstrap (space
   separated) or to individual pacman(8) commands after changing root.

Configure the system

  Fstab

   Generate an fstab file (use -U or -L to define by UUID or labels):
# genfstab -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

   Check the resulting file in /mnt/etc/fstab afterwards, and edit it in
   case of errors.

  Chroot

   Change root into the new system:
# arch-chroot /mnt

  Time zone

   Set the time zone:
# ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone/subzone /etc/localtime

   Run hwclock(8) to generate /etc/adjtime. If the time standard is set to
   UTC, other operating systems should be configured accordingly.
# hwclock --systohc --utc

  Locale

   Uncomment the needed locales in /etc/locale.gen, then generate them
   with:
# locale-gen

   Add LANG=your_locale to locale.conf(5), and if required, console keymap
   and font to vconsole.conf(5).

  Hostname

   Create an entry for your hostname in /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts. See
   hostname(5) and hosts(5) for details.

  Network configuration

   Configure the network for the newly installed environment: see Network
   configuration.

   For Wireless configuration, install the iw, wpa_supplicant, and dialog
   packages, as well as needed firmware packages.

  Initramfs

   When making configuration changes to mkinitcpio.conf, create a new
   initial RAM disk with:
# mkinitcpio -p linux

  Root password

   Set the root password:
# passwd

  Boot loader

   See Category:Boot loaders for available choices and configurations.
   Choices include GRUB (BIOS/UEFI), systemd-boot (UEFI) and syslinux
   (BIOS).

   If you have an Intel CPU, in addition to installing a boot loader,
   install the intel-ucode package and enable microcode updates.

Reboot

   Exit the chroot environment by typing exit or pressing Ctrl+D.

   Optionally manually unmount all the partitions with umount -R /mnt:
   this allows noticing any "busy" partitions, and finding the cause with
   fuser(1).

   Finally, restart the machine by typing reboot: any partitions still
   mounted will be automatically unmounted by systemd. Remember to remove
   the installation media and then login into the new system with the root
   account.

Post-installation

   See General recommendations for system management directions and
   post-installation tutorials (like setting up a graphical user
   interface, sound or a touchpad).

   For a list of applications that may be of interest, see List of
   applications.
